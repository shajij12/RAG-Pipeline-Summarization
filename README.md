# RAG Pipeline Summarization

## Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline in Python to generate accurate, domain-specific summaries using live web data. Implemented retrieval through DuckDuckGo Search and BeautifulSoup for text scraping, followed by chunking, embedding generation (SentenceTransformer all-MiniLM-L6-v2), and similarity ranking with FAISS. Integrated Hugging Face Transformers (BART-large-CNN) for summarization, paraphrasing, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) for output refinement. Designed a Tkinter GUI for user interaction, enabling real-time query-based summarization.
